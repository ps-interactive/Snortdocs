</H1>

<P>
OK, all of these commands are pretty cool, but if you want to record the
packets to the disk, you need to specify a logging directory and Snort will
automatically know to go into packet logger mode:

<P>
<PRE>
    ./snort -dev -l ./log
</PRE>

<P>
Of course, this assumes you have a directory named <code>log</code>  in the current
directory. If you don't, Snort will exit with an error message. When Snort runs
in this mode, it collects every packet it sees and places it in a directory
hierarchy based upon the IP address of one of the hosts in the datagram.

<P>
If you just specify a plain -l switch, you may notice that Snort sometimes uses
the address of the remote computer as the directory in which it places packets
and sometimes it uses the local host address. In order to log relative to the
home network, you need to tell Snort which network is the home network:

<P>
<PRE>
    ./snort -dev -l ./log -h 192.168.1.0/24
</PRE>

<P>
This rule tells Snort that you want to print out the data link and TCP/IP
headers as well as application data into the directory <code>./log</code>, and you
want to log the packets relative to the 192.168.1.0 class C network. All
incoming packets will be recorded into subdirectories of the log directory,
with the directory names being based on the address of the remote
(non-192.168.1) host. 

<P>

        
        <p><table border="1"><tr><td><b>
        Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<P>
Note that if both the source and destination hosts are on the home network,
they are logged to a directory with a name based on the higher of the two port
numbers or, in the case of a tie, the source address.

<P>
        
        </b></td></tr></table></p>

<P>
If you're on a high speed network or you want to log the packets into a more
compact form for later analysis, you should consider logging in binary mode.
Binary mode logs the packets in tcpdump format to a single binary file in the
logging directory:

<P>
<PRE>
    ./snort -l ./log -b
</PRE>

<P>
Note the command line changes here. We don't need to specify a home network any
longer because binary mode logs everything into a single file, which eliminates
the need to tell it how to format the output directory structure. Additionally,
you don't need to run in verbose mode or specify the -d or -e switches because
in binary mode the entire packet is logged, not just sections of it. All you
really need to do to place Snort into logger mode is to specify a logging
directory at the command line using the -l switch--the -b binary logging
switch merely provides a modifier that tells Snort to log the packets in
something other than the default output format of plain ASCII text.

<P>
Once the packets have been logged to the binary file, you can read the packets
back out of the file with any sniffer that supports the tcpdump binary format
(such as tcpdump or Ethereal). Snort can also read the packets back by using
the -r switch, which puts it into playback mode. Packets from any tcpdump
formatted file can be processed through Snort in any of its run modes. For
example, if you wanted to run a binary log file through Snort in sniffer mode
to dump the packets to the screen, you can try something like this:

<P>
<PRE>
    ./snort -dv -r packet.log
</PRE>

<P>
You can manipulate the data in the file in a number of ways through Snort's
packet logging and intrusion detection modes, as well as with the BPF interface
that's available from the command line. For example, if you only wanted to see
the ICMP packets from the log file, simply specify a BPF filter at the command
line and Snort will only see the ICMP packets in the file:

<P>
<PRE>
    ./snort -dvr packet.log icmp
</PRE>

<P>
For more info on how to use the BPF interface, read the Snort and tcpdump man
pages.
